Enter the score gained in Try1 and Try2 to get the final score of that particular frame.

For example, 

In frame 1, when we enter the value '4' in Try1 and the value '2' in Try 2, the sum of these 2 tries i.e. '6' is the final score of first frame.

In frame 2, enter the values of Try 1 and Try2 as '5' and '2' respectively, then the final score of the second frame is 7 which is the sum of the two tries.

If the values of Try 1 and Try2 are ('8' and '2') or ('7' and '3') or ('9' and '1') or ('6' and '4') or ('5' and '5') or ('2' and '8') or ('3' and '7') 
or ('1' and '9') or('4' and '6') => which sums up to the total of the value '10', then the final score of the frame is the sum of 10 and try1 value. This indicates spare.
Spare logic takes the try1 value of same frame. BUt it need corrections where it has to pick up the try1 value of next frame.

Strike logic is incorrect and need modifications. Please ignore strike logic.
